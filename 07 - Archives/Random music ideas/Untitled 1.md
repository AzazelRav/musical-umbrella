Well we'll, 
what do we have here boys...
Someone looking for me, (chuckle)
Isn't this is quite a suprise,
A voice in all those tortured screams. (Laughs from all the men)
You'd of thought he would of ran away,
But he decided to call out to me.
Well well it seems I'll have.
To make
Him.
Regret calling out to me.

*the beat picks up here introducing a jazzy vibe to it with a eerie feel*

Your captian is no longer with us.
What's wrong kid?,
He was just another of these mangey mutts and had to be put down.
He said there was hope for anyone,
But look around and tell me what you see,
Blood on the mud brown stained with red all of his words ended up being just in his head.
