Welcome home my dear friend... it's a been long long time... brothers take a seat, "here?." Yes that would be fine...
So. Where have you all been and tell me why I couldn't find you.. cause i must admit these chains around my leg, make it hard to recognize what is real and what I made to hide the real truth...

*The imperfect clones shatter turning to dust, then fading into the void as the void walker ken starts to break as the song ramps up with drums and a more chaotic vibe*

Why oh why can't I see them?, this isn't fair... THIS ISN'T FAIR!?, 
I begged and pleaded, to remove me, from the void that suffocates those who breath in air!!!, I did everything right., so why am I forced in a world without their light!, 

*The scene continues with Void Walker Ken walking through the void discovering a destroyed shiromuma mansion, his memories fuzzy he walks to the house seeing everything broken cracks everywhere signifying his broken psyche as he walks through the house the song continues*

Memories...
Slowly...
Fade away...
Now it's...
Just only...
Me and some clones who are exactly the same!,...

Let me out,
LET HiM OUT!
So sick of hearing voices,
WHY CAN'T I RECALL WHO I WAS BEFORE THIS!
There are picture of me but not exactly,
AND OTHERS I HAVE NEVER SEEN!?!?,

(A few minutes of screams and guitar)

they tell me that if wanna be free, I have to listen not ever disobey, if this is what it means to be free, then I'd rather be caged by the chains and walk into those charred flames!
Cause it's never ever. Gonna be the same!,
