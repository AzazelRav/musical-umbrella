Lost... oh were lost in this sea...
The tides, they surround and capture you and me, ships parts scattered, many supplies rest in the debris, 

(Sounds of stepping down from steps and the sound of a pop signifying removing a lollipop from your mouth)

Alright men. I understand your tired,
I see the shake in your legs and hands,
But we are stuck inbetween fire and if we leave right now we're good as dead.

(A crew member speaks up)

"Sir, I see a escape if we go now, we can leave this infernal battleground!"

(With a scoff the captain says with a sigh)

But what's the fun in that?,
We are pirates, our lives are full yet so lifeless, we tread the line of dead and Alive so why!, would we try to tip the scales even if either way we fail, it's better we go out... in a blaze of glory.
