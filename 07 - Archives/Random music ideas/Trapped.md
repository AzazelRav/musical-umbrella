I see a fool that's been caught in a web of lies.... 
taken a bite of fruit that is meant to trap in flies...
though I suppose you'll do as well, 
yes. You'll do fine... (bu-)
No. Don't say a word.. it will spoil your taste.... and we have thousands with an appetite for.... your particular race...~
Darling... close your eyes... everything will be fine... let the blade come closer as we prepare you... (what are you doin-)
Ah ah ah, darling what did I just say? No need to question why for a moment you felt that quick bit of pain...
The poison from my fangs will make it slowly slip away... 

You beautiful butterfly... struggle as you build a beautiful tomb... sleep now... rest your weary eyes... your time is nearly through!!

You called to me... your smile drew me in... expected a happy gathering well.. for one of us there is. your wings they are unkept...  we should clip them... as they'll only serve to serve a disaster when we are fed...
