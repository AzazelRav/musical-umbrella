I've been loosing track of time,
Wondering where it goes from here.
So many questions running through my mind overshadowing the constant fears,
Each second that ticks,
makes me feel so so sick,

Headaches..
Migraines...
Chestpains..
It all happens once. Again...

Have I made a big mistake![[]]
Regret each choice I make,
I feel broken and I'm failing to see how any of this shit is fate,

When did this all start,
Writing from the heart breaks me so far apart,
that I can't get a word out without wanting to run away.
