Haven't you noticed who's missing
Don't you know the prince is not around,
I heard today is telemachus's birthday
And I heard today he comes back to town, 
So I say we gather near the beaches,
I say we wait till he arrives!!
I'll slip away while you all distract him,
And I can go prepare the surprises!

Hold em down, while I'm In the kitchen
Hold em down while I start to bake!
Hold em down while we slowly bring his, buddies and family and favorite cake! 
Into tiny pieces, serve it almode!almost!
If the prince wonders what he is gift is, only his mother and Iwill know oh!!
