I see trees in the window, as we're passing by,
Unsure of how I got here and why I,
Can't seem to remember my name or the date and time,
These guys keep on repeating words I've heard throughout my life. 
I tried to speak up but i realized I,
was silenced like footsteps on a cold windy night,
They said I was a killer and I murdered her last night,
I tried to ask who she was,
but they couldn't hear any of the words i said,
Cause it was all in my head,
*sounds of footsteps plays in sync with the melody and low rumbling engine sound*

And. This sound. Is.
The sound of this engine tch. mixed in with my limited perception makes for such a lovelyy sound, 
There's no protection, 
Lost without a mention,
Tossed into cement and burned to the ground.

You hear the shovels and picks bang but that is just a soul that has been lost.
