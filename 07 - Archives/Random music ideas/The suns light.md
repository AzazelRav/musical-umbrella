There once was a treasure that hides,
Between the set and the sun's rise...
The orange glow was our only guide.
But the pink and yellow marked and caught our eyes, 
We searched years for this treasure, each moment never a waste,
We heard stories of the original captain,
He was clever yet didn't have much to say, they say he was an inventor or a writer depending on who you'd take, 
Up this conversation with, but. In the end it's all the same, 

There once was a captain who had a ship that lost its name, and just like her he was quite the same, he barely said a word, but he was a genius but others thought his plans were absurd so he locked himself away.

And.
In that solitude 
Ideas they grew,
as he stared at the sky
His treasure he, decided that it would hide, in the mornings rise and the moment before night.
