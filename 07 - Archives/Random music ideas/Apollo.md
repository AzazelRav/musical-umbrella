**a young boy walking through the throne room his body looking as he was almost dead with scars and wounded and burn marks but in this moment he says in a pleading tone as he sings**

My dear king and queen I have something to annouce...
Your daughter she once was innocent but now she has renounced,
Her humanity and, caused a travesty on a village that was close to me,
And no matter what tone I give,
you will take this as me ripping bits, 
Of, Your daughter's legacy into scraps with tiny notes,
But listen I have on great authority, that her words her hoax,
