All soldiers are actually prisoners that are forced into the war.

I see... 
your broken eyes filled with
Your discarded tears...
I know your scared...
consumed by those unwanted chained away fears...
You all had to smile for so long...
I bet you all felt so hopeless. 
(< voice Crack and emotion should be shown here.)
excuse me. 
(Take a hearable deep breath to show emotion and the pain you feel for them, then continue as all the prisoners listen one about to speak up as you continue)
Do you feel resentment?...
If you do take it out on me...
Cause as much as I want to let you go me dying is the only way you'll get to leave...
