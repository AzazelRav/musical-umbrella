Xavier was a 15 year old boy who was bullied in every way you can think of physically and  mentally  every day he wakes up to his sister barricading him in his room and hiding all his school supplies, throwing away his notepad which he draws in to help let out the bad emotions he allows  himself to feel everyday from Every bad impulse but lately Xavier has been staying up all night not getting any sleep and it's really getting to him, he's seeing things that aren't there, more often then usual  and keeps seeing this black clouded figure who vanishes before Xavier can even get close to him, well... that's what use to happen, now the boy looks like his dead friend and taunts him using the voices of others, sometimes even changing the shape of the person it's mimicking but once it's done  it will always go  towards Xavier but then the world collapses and all that is there is 7 doors each locked with chains but 1, but no matter how hard he tries the door will not budge.
