Broken souls of whom never rose,
Pricked by the thorns that's how it goes,
The wind flows and takes the petal
With the dandelions filled with the dreams all lost to the kids even a were left by you and me,
The inner child crying cause they never got the chance to be anything but what their parents wanted them to be,
They use to tell them selves fame will make them happy,
Truthfully fame is toxicity it never really is the way it seems,
And you'll started doing things you'd never dreamed,
Then bottle it up until the whole ocean has run out,
And not eat or a drink not an ounce,
