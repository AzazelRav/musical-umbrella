Diss diss diss,
All you ever do is this this,
It's snowing so I guess winters gonna hit,
Let me grab the flame thrower so I can incinerate this bitch,
(Heh)

{Verse 1}
Sorry did I offend the snowflake?,
It's only natural cause your a snow bunny,
And I'm a snow fox isn't that funny?,
That God has sent you my way cause on the food chain I'm the one who prey pray to never meet,
cause if they ever do there dead meat and then I'll have a feast with my family oh and that's reminds me,
The boss wants to meet you upstairs says theres a surprise he can't wait to share,
But word of the wise the guy is more cuckoo then I,

{Verse 2} 
Come inside.
I see you've taken your time to clear your mind as you climb the stairs that are mine,
But your already scared for your life that I graciously have allowed you,
But your not bringing any value to the table it's like you never left the cradle do you want to end up like man who is fabled to be killed by me?, (Allegedly)
But that's all in the past right we don't have another mistake like that one that left 2 guys in cast the other night,
