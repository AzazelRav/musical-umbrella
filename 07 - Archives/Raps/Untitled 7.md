The moment you wake up it's pulling you down,
Anxiety as you talk to people
Gotta hide behind the mask so you can clown around,
This evil entity makes no sound,
You don't even know it's there till it shows up,
smiling one minute then your a wreck,
Wait no a fuck up,
Cause the moment it enters your stuck in place,
It's set then checkmate,
You can check the rook but the king hasn't been here since his first day,
The demon broke down it's walls,
Invaded and captured us all,
And the commander abandoned us on this old ship,
Damn I think it's sinking quick but it's still moving towards something but right now it's only gray and pink objects,
And our brain and mind are running all over the place,
Hey you would mind if I leave this floor to you,
At the bottom there is riots,
at the top someone sprung a leak and if we don't fix it soon the enemy will see,
And then we truly will never be able to continue are dreams.
