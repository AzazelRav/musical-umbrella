I've been talking to graves everyday
Askin how they ended up in this place,
And they tell the same story about not enough done just wasting time in space,
Or how they never got to see the end of their thirty year run,
Talked about alot of metaphors with strings tied around fingers but there never coming off,
cause they were cut off,
Now hopes of achieving feels like hopeless dreaming, 
souls gotten lost searching for the meanin,
Never found the purpose assumed they never earned it,
Watches the tides saw them turnin but still never found their purpose,
