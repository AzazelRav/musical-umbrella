Memory lane,
I probably should took a turn at the innerstate,
But honestly I kinda missed this place,
It may have my darkest days
But I wouldn't give them away,
Because the old me this is where he stays,
I didn't have a place for him at the time so I left him here to die,
maybe I should stop by and see how he's doing,
Then again I think he still wants me to be on the other end of his shooting,
So maybe another time,
See you later other me I hope you never die
But for now I'll drive away so we can prevent another big fight,
But now something isn't feeling right,
It's like I lost a part of my life,
So fuck it I'll park this car right by the door, jump out and run up to the fourth floor,
Run to door six o five bust it open
And i arrived to late.
My other side is already past heaven's gate
