It always starts the same,
You laugh and smile through out the day,

But pain always creeps in,
Now that old floorboard seems to be breathing,
And you swear you saw something beneath them,
Opened up your eyes to the demon,
And no there not inner more real then anything guess you can say they are bitter with people with a wedding ring,
They were always betting on your demise but they rolled the dice and always got double snake eyes so that marriage it stayed intacted,
You and your wife made a pact to always take what is earned and never give it back it was like that love would never perish like fairy tales and the magic carriage,
But this time no God mother could fix this tragic wedlock she been checking her phone an awful lot but says she just checking the clock but her eyes tell she was on another app,
Her fingers swipe then 3 taps she claims she just unlocking her phone
