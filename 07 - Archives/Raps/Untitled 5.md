Better off alone,
That's what I tell them but I'm only 16 years old
Guess I was thrown into the cold,
Gave the shoulder to many friends,
Yet I wonder why they left at the end
Couldn't think about it for a minute then I guess I'm better off in this dead end but I gotta turn even if I'll crash and burn cause I promised I would return to them in good health but I'm stuck in the medicine cabinet third shelf but these tablets from the bottles don't help,
All it does it make my hormones go from the lowest to the highest tier burst into tears,
Called my ex her name is fear I told her I needed here and now,
Was in a delusion,
started pollution with these unholy sounds,
But the screams were the only sounds that wouldn't cut out,
They would follow me all around,
Fear told me it was nothing to worry about,
Then later would put me down,
Saying I was nothing but a guy who only followed the stereotype that was passed around,
