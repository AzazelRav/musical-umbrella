Seven words out the gate,
Took a turn saw your devil gaze
Was amazed by the promises but I shouldn't of let go so easily,
I should of held on to it,
not just fallen right in your basket and then took every hit like your racket as you wipe off your sweat then take a knee, 
knowing you control every part of me,
Kicked me in the face grabbed my hair slammed me in the dirt I guess that's why they say music is bitter if you start at your worst,
but how did we get this way,
Wanting to dig myself in the ground everytime you say it's not okay,
Broken by the sounds of laughing even if that's how people congratulate,
Close my eyes and mediate and all I see is your devil eyes.
At least I tried.
Fuck even now hearing this sound it reminds me how we use to be,
It was all lovey dovey now is just your fucking ugly.
Guess reality wanted to remind me I was nothing as they pulled the rug under me.
