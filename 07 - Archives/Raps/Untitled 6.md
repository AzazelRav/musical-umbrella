I'm trapped inside,
Inside your mind,
Racing around to find,
The exit but first I must be careful of the chains,
Cause they have been left all over the place,
Well not every section has them just the ones that cause pain,
I apologise I didn't mean to invade your personal space,
And that I learned things you wanted locked in a bloody safe,
I can hear you getting farther as your hiding from the monsters that were once under your bed
Now they are running keeping the same pace moving all around your head,
Broken glass infused with the tears that have been shed,
And words on the walls one says fake friends,
While another one says,
Uh actually nevermind let's just skip that, 
I think prefer to keep it under wraps,
But there a door right here it seems to have many cracks, open it up and it's like a fire mixed with a bomb blast,
Broken promises made to you on the floor,
And bottles of Joy killed with gallon's of chloroform,
And other stuff I'll keep between us and the door,
Something about this feeling is hurting my heart and core,
I can sense alot of issues are held behind that closet door,
I would go inside to check but I feeling that this place was abandoned and left in a wreck,
Sounds of footsteps play as the beat lowers but you hear quick rapid breaths like someone is scared or running
So I guess I'll check your heart it's the only beat I recognize and I feeling you'll agree, 
Looked around the door was there but now it was moved and without a sound, 
It seems I've been found and about to be kicked out,
Hearing lots of sounds I follow them as my time is sure to run out,
I open and the door and all I see is you,
Smiling dancing and humming to a tune, 
didn't realize it then but the only sound was you, 
Hugged you and whispers in a soft calming voice,
You may not trust me or have issues believing I'm being true but I promise this *whispers in your ear as the beat stops before the final words come out of my mouth*
