Let me ask you a question about your
Friendships has a new started or an old one ended?,
Or is it all just pretend shit the for the camera or was it for the fame and you feel hated,
It's such shame people play with others feelings,
and the meaning gets twisted around,
to the point words start bouncing around 
it surrounds now but the stero is at zero so how, 
Is this car moving up and down like a beating,
Heart but there was a mark from all the shit I did and didn't say,
I know it wasn't right for me lie,
The shit I said as a kid still makes me want to die,
But why the hell you gonna hold it over me for the rest of my life,
I get alright it wasn't good to lie about having a rose,
I was just a petal and wind just flowed,
I taken into a mine field with no hope,
(But)
I just got to say it now,
How damn proud of the person I've become,
Because of all you and a certain special someone,
I am who am know and I wouldn't give it for any other talents or sounds, 
(The sound of the beat distortes as crying and rain can be heard)
Look.
Ken your greatest friend I could ever have,
I'm sorry about all the shit I did in the past,
Like lying about and girl and at the end covering it up saying she was kidnapped,
I get it I'm a fucking ass and I should hang myself and never be allowed to breath in this gas we call air, 
But truthfully I owe my life to you my brother,
You made me who I am gave me support even though I sounded like a squeaky door,
I'll be around evermore I hope there never comes a time where we gotta close this door,
Because your the sword and I'm shield and your the person who knows the shit I've done and how it really made me feel. 
Yeah haha so let me say this,
I love everyone I talk to,
I wouldn't ever want harm to come to any one of you,
So when I'm pushed away it really fucks with my brain,
I started thinking I did something to ruin someone's day,
I'm a delicate flower as they would say,
So I just wanted to say your all my best friends cause I couldn't choose only one of you. 
Heh bye now just know I love all of you.

(Sounds of walking away can be heard echoing through a school as the sounds of people screaming don't jump can be heard but the sirens fade in as it goes full silent before the climax could happen)
