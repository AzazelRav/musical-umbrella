E: any last words?.
*silence with a tiny breath*
D: just one..., may the sirens feast on all your foolhardy souls, as they are about to do to me.
*gasps from the crowds as it quickly is only D chuckling to himself*
D: my apologies. That was more then one.
K: I'VE HEARD ENOUGH. drop him into the ocean along with the corpses of those pirate, Scum.
D: My king...,you should watch who you call scum, Especially since... you are far worse, then those men ever were. 
*sounds of outrage from the crowd as K grabs D by the neck as k chuckles this line*
K: HOW DAre you..., you think literal pirates are better then royalty?.
D: If I do?. what?, are you going to strip me away from my thoughts now as well?
*K, without hesitation straps shackles on D's wrist and pushes him into the ocean as K laughs*
K: you've always had such a talkative mouth, it's a shame... you were loyal to the very end. 
*K sighs his voice going cold and emotionless*
K: just to the wrong people. 
*with that K walks away refusing to watch as he plans his next moves and D struggles to breath as he forced to the bottom of the ocean from shackles connected to an anchor, as he lays there at the bottom he gasps for air trying to free himself as he sees a siren he knows this is it, he sighs and pulls out a pendant from his long dead wife as he begins to sing (the singing is more symbolic then literal as he is definitely drowning)

So, it's finally my time...
Would you have been, proud of me and the life that I lived?, or would you have preferred I stayed in line...?,
What I've done, I will admit, that I don't regret a second of that time...
As It was for you, a foolish thing to do, but I'd do it all again, just to save you...


*the sound of the beat is of a heart beat with quick but inconsistent bow strings as the song tone changes to one a mystical mysterious vibe and the scene changes to the past where he was Infront of the pirate ship that ruined his life and brought him here*

D: well... I'm here Amy. 
*Devan says as he clutches a boat shaped locket* 
D: I'll find a way to bring you back... 
*Devan walks towards the ship but is stopped by a women with crimson red hair as she yells in authorative tone*
S: I already had a ship inspection last week! *she sighs as she walks down the steps meeting Devan face to face* 
S: they said there was nothing wrong so why do you guards keep insisting on hassling me and my men!?,
D: P-Please your mistaken. I am not a guard...
*the melody picks up in a very energetic but interrogating vibe*

So you say your not a guard?
Well darling forgive me if I sound rude...
