**a slow piano plays with one key being played out of tone**
_____________________
Staring at the sky...
Get Lost in the thoughts that through the day stopped by...
Loosen the line...
That holds you down and slowly kills you inside...,
The mind is a weapon...
Isn't that what you use to say?...
It's been used for years...
To ignore the fact you ran away...!!
**A tiny bit of jazz plays as the tone shift** 
Haha...

Welcome welcome why dont you come inside...
X:No im go-
Hey! Don't worry,
that guy over there he won't bite.
X:But-
Just relax you can trust me darling I have your.
safety. in. mind.
And no Matter what.
I'm by your side... **a slightly sinister chuckle but a short jazz break**

Lookie lookie what we have right here,
This boy keeps crying but..
that's not the sounds that we wanna hear!! **the record scratches and the piano plays again with a tiny bit of trumpet but no saxophone**

So won't you be a dear...
and kindly shut your trap.
X:I-I can't it's too ha-
Oh well in that case...
your worries and fears aren't good for any type of conversation...
So bottle it up and drink it up and pretend. 
To laugh..
Cause when you talk,
Everyone agrees, 
And if you were to ask me...
It's like a full on interrogation!...
**another sinister chuckle**
Oh dear oh me oh my, seems my words have left you in state that breaks you will and leaves you hollow on the outside
