I'm... sick of this... can't you all see... the kings orders are truly... draining on us citizens, as we choke back our screams...

(The melody picks up slightly as you hear footsteps as the king of thieves walks to a child looking worse for ware as he speaks again )

Look at us... covered in dust and our clothing in shreds, he commands... and expects us... to work and serve till we are deaddd! (Sound of slamming fist on a table)

Your children are going hungry.
