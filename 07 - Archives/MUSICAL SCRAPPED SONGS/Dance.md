B: Sir!, how was the ball, was it as bad as you thought it would be?.
P: If I'm being honest... i had a good time, it was almost a bore but. I met someone,


So there I was, all alone trying to drown my sorrows but. everyone in that party was so fake. 

B: it couldn't of been that bad sir,
P: I assure you it was.
B: how so?
P: *sigh*

Now and then, one of my, fathers friends or supporters would come by and make themselves known, they'd go on and on, trying to convince and sell me on something, their always just after something, 


B: Sir, I believe your getting sidetracked, you said you met someone who changed the night?
P: yes.
P: the moment they stepped into my sight my eyes refused to look away...

As i was speaking to a duke of a neighboring town, a voice it rose above the rest and overpowered the crowds of, 

Except for one. Oh that one. their eyes their clothes. the way they stood unopposed. my mind said danger but my eyes just wouldn't let go...
Next thing I know my eyes are locked with their's, they give a smirk and started to walk slow, if I only listened to the warning of danger... I wouldn't of been caught in their hold...

B: then what happened?
P: im not sure if should say more,
B: please Sir!, I must know what happened!,
P: very well.

They smiled and bowed infront of me, with a smirk mixed with glee, talked about how It must be so lonely at the top...
It caught me off guard that I'll admit, tried to not laugh but a bit of it slipped,
They stood and offered a hand... said would you care to dance... i said no, I refused the offer they gave, but he smiled and just said...

Poor little prince.. always hiding away, when was the last time a true smile was on your face, come dance with me I'll show you true joy... lost oh your lost but I can find the real you again... lost oh your lost... close your eyes and feel anew again!, lost oh your lost but with me ill make you feel alive...~ so tell me prince that your willing to try...

B: I'm sorry sir but did you just say he?,
P: uh, no. no it must of just sounded like that.
B: very well. *he says with a sigh* please do continue,
