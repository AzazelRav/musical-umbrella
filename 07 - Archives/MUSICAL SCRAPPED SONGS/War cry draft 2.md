(Adrien is in the war zone with kenryth they are both fighting and after an altercation he Is badly wounded by a arrow to the chest, and due to lack of medical supplies he will not survive to see the end of this war)
Kenryth: please... don't die on me...
Adrien: heh... hey... it... will be okay... (Adrien looks over to a pouch on his jacket, sounds effects will further emphasize this)
I... (he winces in pain) i.. wrote my will in case i died in this war... i... (The blood pours out more of his color in his face) read it to our comrades...

Kenryth: my friends.... 
I have a grave announcement to make ...
Our Commander has been slain...
/
And on his person was a will he wanted me to share..., 

(in this entire next bit you need to show sadness as you speak but only letting it leak out when you end a sentence) 
It says... 
there isn't time for roses.
Nor to grieve and throw the blame,
We're all friends here and... 
We have to have survive for his sake...
(The first skip happens here but it's not that noticeable other then a slightly more confident sounding voice)
So don't you dare run... away men.
I can sense your tired...
And i know your scared...
All of you have seen the death of your fellow men,
(Another subtle switch more confidence in his voice with the cadence in it to show that confidence)
While others... have seen destruction with their own eyes
