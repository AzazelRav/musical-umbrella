Why can't you just, listen to me,
Your words, Your words, they've stricken and wounded me, 
The amount of times you've caused me to bleed, it won't ever heal, if you pretend that you don't see, no. It won't ever heal cause you refuse to acknowledge what you've done to me,

(Tiny shaky breath then continue)

Im, staring at the glass and the cracks you've made, we, no me, I'm the only one picking up the past hoping to fix the mirror of your mistakes, another prick from the shards as you seal my fate, i, lost myself in the reflections you, no. I made, this red is mixing in and it ruins the clear view I once had, ive been, forcing a smile in a shattered perception, hoping no one realizes the truth of my deception...

(Another shakey breath then with a scream and a bang of the mirror)

You can stare back at me,
But. I know It doesn't matter how hard you try to not make a sound, cause,
Your lies they've seeped and festered and this growing paranoia, is the only reason I'm unable to get out... (voice cracking on this line >) and it's just, a Neverending nightmare, so... one more time, tell me it's not enough just to stare, through the pane of that old window to my soul. And now i hold onto these, glasses that you gave to me. and there the last thing I'll see of that perfect reality... she says... there cracked. and. useless... just like me. so I'm here again... locking away... everything.  In this busted mirror... that holds my screams.... (The song ends with the boy crying clutching the glasses)
