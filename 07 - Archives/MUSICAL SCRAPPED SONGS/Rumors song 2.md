Has it really been that long...?,
Since the incident.
It feels like it was just yesterday, 
Oh how I'm missing how we'd sing along to those old dumb songs...
Now I can't help but cry when I hear your voice in the videos we made...
I wish I was there... i wish I wish..
I could of saved you but... I was too late...

*the bus pulls up the sounds go quiet as the bus makes a full stop the doors open making that steam sound as it opens as the voice of people can be heard as Xavier walks up towards the steps, he feels their gazes. he wants to hide but he can't as he walks towards the back of the bus he hears them speaking he listens as the sounds pick up violins play in rapid succession the bows violent and powerful making the atmosphere feel cruel and unwelcoming but slowly goes back to a piano for him as the Song begins in a low piano tone*

Welcome to hell... close your eyes or pretend, that others can't tell...,
That you have no friends.
There eyes they stare...
Why do they glare!,
Did I say something wrong?.
Did I do something incorrect?...
Or was I just a bad person who is chosen to be treated with nothing less then... death!. 
*the song picks up back to the violent violins and piano*

C: why is that stupid song playing so loud...
J: yeah. I agree, shut up and throw it out...
P: it a guess why he's still holding onto his past... 
D: with a boy he will no longer have!...
