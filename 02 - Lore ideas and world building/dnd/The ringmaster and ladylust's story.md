The ringmaster and lady-lust were childhood friends and neighbors until one day where a robber broke in and stole everything, when their parent’s finally arrived it was too late they were shot the moment their parents walked through the door, 

loss struck them both differently as they were forced into a orphanage, the ringmaster fell into a psychotic break and started seeing people who didn’t actually exist, he’d put on shows and performances often getting hurt even burning his hand and needing to wear bandages on his hands with how often he does tricks with fire, lady-lust often had to bandage him up as he got hurt but due to his fractured perspective of people he truly believes that she isn’t real, 

she constantly needs to remind him that she is real and one day frustrated she tries kissing him to make him understand and even then it didn’t work he see’s her differently now but still is convinced one day she will just poof be gone

The ringmaster and lady-lust were childhood friends and neighbors until one day where a robber broke in and stole everything, when their parent’s finally arrived it was too late they were shot the moment their parents walked through the door, 

the loss of her parents was alot to handle, and even worse her friend’s parent died as well and to top it all off they were forced into a orphanage, 

so she made it her mission to keep him safe with... little to no success, so she now finds herself bandaging him up and comforting him when he gets scared, she truly cares for him but is frustrated that he seems to believe that she isn’t real, it started to eat at her mental state till the point of breaking and one night during a storm in a last ditch effort to make him see her as a person she kissed him, it worked for... a tiny bit alot of words were thrown around but even now he still is... not ready to accept the truth and until he does she refuses to leave his side that... and she really doesn’t want to be alone


COME ONE COME ALL WITNESS THE TERRIFYING POPTASTIC DUO OF DESTINY ENTERTWINED BY FATE TILL THE FINAL CURTAIN FALLS

lady-lust is devoted to the ringmaster, she could tell you anything about him without even needing to think about it, she often will say i love you to him and grip his jacket till he says it back, if he refuses to say it after a bit she will get annoyed and just kisses him everytime without fail he says it back,
