# The very early years before the story

Lee’s parent’s were taken away from him at a young age due to them being considered [[crimes|Criminals]], for half the year they were tortured and paraded around with many other prisoners to remind the lower-class that they were powerless and to keep them in check,

he watched as his mother was burned alive , his father was never seen again as he was shipped away on a [[Enslaved boat|boat]],

~~he was taken in by his uncle (name to figured out) and was kept safe~~ but also was forced to be a criminal to survive, 

during this time he met a [[Melisandra|mysterious girl]] who refused to show her face, they became friends but lee grew curious on who she really was until one day he gained the guts to ask her name, she started laughing as her hood slid off slightly revealing her beautiful dark blue hair before she grabbed it and pulled it back on,

after seeing that it consumes him as he can’t stop thinking of her, he went to visit her day after day but one day he went to visit her and was greeted with devastating news from a knight informing him that the girl he was looking for had died.
