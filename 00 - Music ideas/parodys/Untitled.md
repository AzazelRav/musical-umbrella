Pride is a damsel in distress  
Hiding away where only I can undress her  
Try all she can not to confess  
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure

all your characters will be in distress
hiding away where only i can hurt them...
Try all you can not to confess your story
In the end, it's all the same once I apply all the pressure

Thunder, bring her through the wringer,  
Show her I'm the judgment call  
The one who makes her kingdom fall  
Lightning, wield her, use and yield her,  
Show her what she can't conceal  
For true nature will be revealed

Ahh
