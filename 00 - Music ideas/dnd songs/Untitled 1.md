One drip of their infected blood is all it should take,
and a 5 petals of the darkest flowers... make sure to grind them up so the taste doesn't start to overpower... 
next take a needle and a loose string or thread, 
undo your own outfit if it's what is needed to stop them from being dead... this is your one and only purpose... so go on and hold that fated breath. and prick.. the the root of the red and purple flower have liquid slowly drip out and then. Distill what was inside toss the salt and hope that color changes from purple to red... 


(Nothing happens as Dia giggles) "Well... you tried." _giggle_ It was such a good attempt as well but... _giggles_ We both know you are nothing without that book and without that recipe... _she giggles louder_ they surely are going to die...~
