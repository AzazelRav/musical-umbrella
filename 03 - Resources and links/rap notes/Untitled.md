A Rhyme is a reputation of similar sounding words 

A Perfect Rhyme, as known as a pure rhyme is when the final stressed vowel sound (A.E.I.O.U)
And all it the following sounds in a word are the same.

Example:
Slime
Prime
Lime
Dime
Chime
Mine

But pine is not because the sounds after the vowel don't match the I'm sound 

Another type of Rhyme is Consonance sounds

Example of it as shown: Time

Tom 
Tim 
Tame 
Tome
And team,

The reason they match is because of the T and M as those letters are in the word time so It can be used for even more experiment,

Rich Rhymes:â†“

Homographs: Words that use the same letters and sound but have two different meanings, 

Examples,
I want to go to the fair,
This isn't fair,
But it is not fare as it has completely different letters even though they sound identical in any other way,

Homophones: Words that use the same sound,
But have different letters and meanings

Examples
Rays 
Raze
Raise
Ray's
And race

End rhymes:
Rhymes that match on the last word or your bar or groups of bars.

For example,

Blah blah blah blah blah blah bar,
Blah blah blah blah blah blah star,

Internal ryhmes: which are ryhmes that match within the same bar or groups of bars,

Example:

Blah blah car, blah blah bar
Blah blah far, blah blah star.

Holo-rhymes, which is when every one of the words or sounds in your bar matches the following bars,

For example:

He was robert oppenheimer.
The atomic bomb designer,
