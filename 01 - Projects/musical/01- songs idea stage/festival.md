This is the beginning of the song,

the song begins with a crowd chattering the melody has yet to happen, the conversations will consist of them talking of the food and other things all this is important to show that they are not allowed to actually eat till the royals give them permission, after a minute the royals show up, this is made clear by the fanfare and the motif of Melisandra as they all walk down the stairs. 
Melisandra feels.. shy in this moment, as if she has no voice, but as her mother and father speak they announce that Melisandra will be starting the festival, melisandra will have no idea this was happening and when she is forced up on the stage she will wince slightly, the fanfare will steps close to the rail, looking down at all the people in the foyer, her voice... nervous slightly cracking, as if she hasn’t spoken in hours and her voice is dry and rougher, the song will begin like this, 

m: um... hello... could i... perhaps have a moment of your time... *the queen scoffs as no one listens*

Q: a queen doesn’t doesn’t ask she demands the respect, you are a thorn veil that’s as good as it gets, so speak from your chest
K: and show them why you are above the rest...
(at the same time)
q: and try again.
k: and try again.
(after this the song should become more calm and the royal motif should fade and a type of mystical sound should play along with melisandra’s instrument) 

m: people of this kingdom... won’t you hear my words...
