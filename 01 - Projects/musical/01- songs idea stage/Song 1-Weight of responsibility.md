the song begins with a knight looking for melisandra, calling out her name, as melisandra is outside in a garden, it flashes to him asking people and everyone saying until a butler says he saw her outside, as we hear laughs and grunts as we arrive to find [[Melisandra]] outside climbing back up to her room signifying she has more to her then meets the eye, the knight calls out her name as she is surprised and falls into a bush wincing and groaning in pain as the knight chuckles walking to her telling her that her father asked for her company in his office 

(we can just skip this i just like world building) [[Melisandra]] walks into the room slowly with a sort of shy scared vibe as if the feeling of freedom is locked away as she steps into the room her father chuckles and says in a oddly calm yet terrifying tone 

k: ah. *you hear a cup being placed on the table* you are finally here. take a seat.

m: you wanted to see me fa- *the king hushes her*

k: shh. your already late; don’t waste any more time stating the obvious,

*she just sits you hear a frantic sound of her fumbling to get the chair to pull back in so she is seated properly [[Melisandra]] takes a breath to speak but goes silent as her father speaks*

*he clears his throat as he let’s out a sigh* 
k: you’re mother asked me to talk with you. she thinks, that it is time you start acting like a princess and less like those urchins that walk the streets.

m: b-but you said i was fine just being a display piec- *once again the king hushes her and she goes silent from fear*

k: shh. i wasn’t done melisandra. you’re to attend the royal ball tomorrow, there you will meet your betrothed, you are to not embarrass our family’s name and YOU WILL. make a good impression. are we clear?.

m:  *her voice shakes* yes...father...

k:*a hint of regret seeps in his voice* the boys name is Andraious.(an drey us) I picked him, much to your mothers chagrin. *his voice is cold as he speaks of her* now... I have other important things to attend to so I’ll be leaving, I’ll send a knight for you in the morning.

m:*tears pour out of her as she screams in frustration punching the wall then wincing cause of the pain as she says in a pained expression*.

*the knight goes to her asking if she is okay as she just stands up taking a deep breath as the knight escorts her to her room as he says in a kind caring tone a stark contrast to her fathers tone* have a goodnight princess.

*she walks to the window crying as she grips the windowsill as the song begins
