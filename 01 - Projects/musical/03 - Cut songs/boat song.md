# Ideas for the song
lee after being knocked out and thrown onto the boat wakes up, a mystical sound (the sirens) will be heard as he awakes, as he looks around the chains will swing as he is greeted to tons of people muttering in fear some praying to the deity's by name, but it’s quickly drowned out by the sound of a wave crashing into a boat, he mumbles the words “Melisandra.. why.” 

he looks around and starts singing, (each wave that crashes into the boat will signify that reality is trying to break through the sirens spell and each memory he goes through will have a crashing wave sound against the boat signifying the change)

this songs first part will take him through memories of him and melisandra as they were young, the song should embody child like wonder and a adventurous vibes, the second part will reveal his insecurities of his life his regrets and at that part end the young melisandra will turn into the older one that we follow in his memories, 

what will follow is a rendition of the first part where he is more confident less saddened as if he is accepting that he cares for melisandra like he did for the hooded girl as the memory melisandra sings with him confessing to him as that is his greatest desire they sing and at the end of this part Melisandra will start singing the siren motif and lee will sing along but after a bit the final wave crash will happen and Melisandra’s voice will distort into the sirens and lee will snap out of it as he questions where that sound is coming from as the song will changes into something more chaotic less foreboding and more trapping and emotional suffocation, and the sirens will start singing tempting the other sailors maybe mix a lot of desires into one in a way that feels chaotic but still feels very... powerful
 
# cut songs
~~the words echo for a second as all sounds stop. the waves are all that remain as the boat rocks back and forth, a seconds later the vibe changes, the somberness is changed to more of adventure feeling of setting sail, we want to convey that this is the beginning of [[Lee|Lee’s]] evolution and change, the world must wrap around him make this feel as if his hero song, it isn’t but... you want to sell that this is.  in a way with the background music make it seem as if the sirens are following the boat with maybe during a wave crash hear nails scratching against the wood of the ship really the whole time even in the most heroic moments of the song, make it feel as if there is something is looming a threat that is close by at all times,

# the song lyrics
(lee awakes after being knocked out and dragged onto the boat his mind racing, he hears a distant voice that sounds like a women he cannot recognize, the va for this part should be the siren or melisandra whatever sounds more... calming almost as if a music box is singing this)

siren: don’t. you. feel betrayed... i. hear. all of your pain... and. i. want to offer my hand to you... just let me make your dreams come true...
