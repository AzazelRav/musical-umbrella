*following an intense discussion between Kenryth and Mordecai, a civilian is spotted spying on them and goes to tell a guard and in split second of fear of being caught Mordecai grabs the civilian and kills him inside of a beautiful garden that was once owned by Mordecai's dead sisters*

K: "My liege why did you run off so sudden-"
There's blood in the garden
M: "lee and the others tell them that we must prepare to flee"
"There's blood in the garden"
"my king you could of let him go, but now... you've shed blood of the innocent in your sisters home!"
"your father would shed a tear if he could see what you've done today-"
"well he can't. he's dead and buried with the flames because of my mistakes."

*the sound of a scream rings out as another civilian sees and screams for a guard as the two run off to get to cover as they run away breathing heavily the sounds of their footsteps muffled by the rain as the song begins with people yelling out*
