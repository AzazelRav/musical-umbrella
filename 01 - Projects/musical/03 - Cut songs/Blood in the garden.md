*following an intense discussion between melissa and lee a fight breaks out and there blades clash but this time lee is not holding back, he kicks her to the ground as he does he slashes his blade down but stops as he sees her crying*

(fear with hints of holding back tears) M: PLEASE! im sorry... I-i swear i didn’t know! you have to believe me!, i only wanted to save her i didn’t think or know that-

(anger and distain) L: that’s exactly why we are here! you never think! you only act on impulse and brought that monster into our safe house! and now... All of those that were there are gone. Dead. taken. Do you have anything to say for yourself!

(silence falls as he sighs remorse in his voice as it shakes as he walks towards a edge) L: i warned you to not help her! (frustration) and yet. you did! im sorry it’s come to this. i really am.

(sadness mixed with planning) M: so am i... 

*as she speaks she pushes him off the bridge and runs as her breathing fades in as the beat fades in as you can hear the panic in her voice as she does so the music beat undecided needs a piano melody of a lullaby type with strings in the background distorting the one calm innocence of our character
